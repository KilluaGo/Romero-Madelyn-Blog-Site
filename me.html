          Hello !! Pleasant and warm welcome to my Blog!! </p>

      <p>My name is Madelyn Romero. I am 20 years old. I was born in our hometown, Belance, Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya. I studied at Belance Central School for my Elementary Level. Junior High School, I studied also at Belance High School. During those days of schooling, I spent hours walking around 3-4.5 kilometers before arriving at the school. And when I was about in High School, I was able to study in the lowland area, where there is an internet connection unlike in the highland area. I studied Senior High School in King's College of the Philippines in Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya taking the Strand of GAS (General Academic Strand). And right now, I am currently studying here in La Verdad Christian College, Apalit Pampanga, taking the course of ACT (Associate in Computer Technology, 2nd-year level SY 2020-2021. I am hoping that I will graduate in 2021 because my course is just 2 years course. This course is really hard for me because I am not able to do some because maybe it is hard to adapt to me. And I am hoping that with God's help, I will be able to graduate for my family.

        I love this bible verse as a quote of mine because it touches me deeply inside.
        <em>"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity " </em> <strong > 1 Corinthians 13:13  </strong>
